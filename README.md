## Introduction

The Logistic Regression model presented in this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to image recognition. By training the model on a dataset of cat images, it is capable of accurately classifying new images as either cats or non-cats.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

To run the Logistic Regression model, execute the `model.py` script. Make sure you have the training and testing datasets available in the specified folder structure. The model will be trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset.

`python model.py`


The model will output the training and testing accuracy, as well as generate relevant plots for visualizing the training process.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this project to suit your needs. You can replace the dataset folder with your own dataset to train the model on different image classes. Additionally, you can adjust the learning rate, number of iterations, and other hyperparameters in the `model.py` script to experiment with different configurations.
